# Machine Learning & Deep Learning
Portofolio about Machine Learning and Deep Learning Project

 # ![1. Churn Prediction](https://github.com/boxside/Dqlab_Churn_Prediction)
 
 
  ![rf](https://github.com/boxside/Dqlab_Churn_Prediction/blob/main/figure/trainrf.png)
 
 
  * first excercise machine learning
  * using dataset about telco churn dataset
  * training modelling using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
  * Random Forest make better result for training model
  
  

 # ![2. Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/boxside/-KModes-Customer_Segmentation)
 
 
  ![kpro](https://github.com/boxside/-KModes-Customer_Segmentation/blob/main/figure/segmentation.png)
 
 
  * modelling using K-prototypes
  * using 3 categories features and 2 numerical features


 # ![3. Twitter's Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/boxside/analisis-sentimen-twitter)
 
 
  ![twitter](https://github.com/boxside/analisis-sentimen-twitter/blob/main/figure/twitter.jpg)
 
 
  * sentiment analysis using tweepy and python readlines
  * with search topic about "uu ite" and "kritik"
  * the result about topic is dominate by **negative sentiment**


 # ![4. Face recognition using OpenCV](https://github.com/boxside/Face_recognition_OpenCV)
 
 
  ![opencv](https://github.com/boxside/Face_recognition_OpenCV/blob/main/muke/Untitled.png)
 
 
  * Face recognition using Haarcascade
  * face recognition training using 4 difference face


 # ![5. AUS's Weather prediction](https://github.com/boxside/AUS_weather_ANN)
 
 
  ![opencv](https://github.com/boxside/AUS_weather_ANN/blob/main/figure/5.png)
 
 
  * Weather prediction using ANN modelling using pytorch
  * had 2 hidden layer each layer with 5 neuron and 3 neuron
  * after 1000 epoch of training model the result get :
  * accuracy : 83%, loss : 0.404
  * had a good recall for no raining prediction (96%) but worst for raining prediction (40%)


 # ![6. MNIST: LRvsANNvsCNN](https://github.com/boxside/MNIST-with_LR-ANN-CNN)
 
 
  ![mnist](https://github.com/boxside/MNIST-with_LR-ANN-CNN/blob/main/output_24_0.png)
 
 
  * MNIST prediction using Logistic Regression,ANN and CNN modelling using pytorch
  * after 15 epoch of training model the result get :
  * CNN had better result between each other (acc:88%,loss:0.40)
  * ANN get lower result from logistic regression, maybe due to had unpotimized ANN model (1 hidden layer with 50 neuron)
